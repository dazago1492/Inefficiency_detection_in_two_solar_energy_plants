# Inefficiency_detection_in_two_solar_energy_plants
## Data analysis
This case studio is a simulation of the work that would be delivered for a solar photovoltaic power generation company.
The identified problem involves an anomalous behaviour that has been detected in two of the plants, with the maintenance company not being able to identify the reason.
Before sending a team of engineers, the data science team is asked to analyse the data gathered by the sensors and meters to see if the problem can be detected.

*This case is developed inside the Python Mastery Data Science Program.*
