# Inefficiency_detection_in_two_solar_energy_plants
## Data analysis
In this case I will be emulating that I am working for a solar photovoltaic power generation company.  The problem is that anomalous behavior has been detected in 2 of the plants and the maintenance subcontractor is not able to identify the reason.  Before sending a team of engineers, they ask the data science team to analyze the data from the sensors and meters to see if we can detect the problem.

*This case is developed inside the Python Mastery Data Science Program.*
